# 1. Desired format of receipt to be
#   #{quantity} #{item description} : #{price + tax}
#   instead of
#   #{quantity} #{item description} : #{quantity * (price + tax)}
# 2. Input should not include import or exempt attributes
# 3. "imported" would always be in the description of an imported item





# send in ruby 
# send version one
# then
# send gold-plate version with Food class etc better structured defaults where they should be 

# class Food < Item
#   initialize
#   always do args
#     always super()
#   end
# over-write applicaable tax
